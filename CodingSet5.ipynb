Because the chapter is function themed I figured I should make both a main function and a function to do the math.  For the main function I asked the user for kilometers, converted the input to a float and then send that number to a not yet made function called \"conversion\" to do the math.  Then I wrote the conversion function, which simply imported the value of kilometers and did the requested formula, returning the result.  Next I wrote the print statement to show the results.  I had one typo in that instead of using the variable kilo, I used kilogram in the formula on first run.  Finally I decided to round to two decimal places because it seems to get excessive, so looked up that process and used the round function."
