    "### Problem **2 Capital Quiz**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that creates a dictionary containing the U.S. states as keys, and their capitals as values. (Use the Internet to get a list of the states and their capitals.) The program should then randomly quiz the user by displaying the name of a state and asking the user to enter that stateâ€™s capital. The program should keep a count of the number of correct and incorrect responses. (As an alternative to the U.S. states, the program can use the names of countries and their capitals.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High-Level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This was actually my second attempt at doing the problem.  The first time I used chatgpt to create my capital/state list and I wasn't sure if that was allowed so started over.  I also really struggled with writing this in general, so took some time to get some practice.  That said, to create this I made a dictionary of states as keys and capitals as values.  Next I created a main function welcoming the user, and turned the keys from the dictionary into a list of states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next I asked the user how many questions they would like, and ran that through a for loop.  In the for loop I used the random function to choose a state from the state list and assign a variable to capital.  I asked a question referencing the state, and checked the answer against the capital variable.  I tallied the correct and incorrect answers and when it was complete I displayed all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest issues I had doing this was in leaving things in the for loop that shouldn't have been.  Such as the tally counters (which reset to 0 on every iteration) and also the final print statement.  I wish I had chosen a different problem, but who knows they all may have been just as challenging for me.  Anyway, good learning experience.\n"
