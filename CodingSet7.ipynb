Next, I had an issue where instead of putting the dollar ammount for sales, I put the day of the week variable in, which created the new list with days of the week again rather than sales numbers.  Both of these were fairly easily fixed.  Next I created a variable for total sales and loop to calculate the total sales and display the result.\n"
