    "This method assigns a value to the _ _name field.\n",

    "Once you have written the class, write a program that creates an object of the class and prompts the user to enter the name, type, and age of his or her pet. This data should be stored as the object’s attributes. Use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve the pet’s name, type, and age and display this data on the screen.\n",

    "I was really happy with this exercise.  I usually dive into something a little harder and stress but for just writing my first class and utilizing it, this was great.  I first created the class pet and created an init to assign innitial statements.  Then I just added the methods as requested.  Finally I requested data from a user, and passed that data to the Pet class, and used a final print statement to dislpay all of the information retrieved from the accessor methods.\n"
