Next I created a list to hold the translation, and used a for loop to fill it with the translated text.\n",

For instance, if the argument is “hello. my name is Joe. what is your name?” the function should return the string “Hello. My name is Joe. What is your name?” The program should let the user enter a string and then pass it to the function. The modified string should be displayed.\n",

I knew I could break down the strings and change each character to an upper, but was unsure of how to set this to trigger other than capitalization.  (like the start of a sentence).  So I searched chatgpt for a solution and thus learned to set a flag to true before starting the loop.  Next I made a for loop checking for the flag, and alpha numeric characters, then capitalizing when needed, setting the flag to false and passing a lower case when not needed.  Finally there is an if statement checking for punctuation, that will set the flag back to True if found.\n"

    "To begin I started with a main function, very similar to every problem here.  I welcomed the user, asked for input, sent input to a function, recieved a return value, and printed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next I created a function to count the frequency of characters.  I had a bit of a head start on this one, it was similar to a problem I did last summer in a 100 days of python class I started (I got to day 8 haha).  Anyway, I used the concept of using boolean to seperate the highest running variable.  I also didn't want spaces counted, so made a string to remove spaces, but figured punctuation would be unlikley but an interesting result so left that in.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had an error with my f string (forgetting the f, and at one point forgetting to even put the variable in there).  I also decided to expand this and send back two variables from the frequency_finder function.  Unfortunatley, I sent back the wrong one at first, but eventually got it right.\n"
