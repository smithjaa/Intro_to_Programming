    "\n",
    "#### Question Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an Employee class that keeps data attributes for the following pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee name\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee number\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, write a class named ProductionWorker that is a subclass of the Employee class. The ProductionWorker class should keep data attributes for the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Shift number (an integer, such as 1, 2, or 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hourly pay rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. The shift attribute will hold an integer value representing the shift that the employee works. The day shift is shift 1 and the night shift is shift 2. Write the appropriate accessor and mutator methods for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have written the classes, write a program that creates an object of the ProductionWorker class and prompts the user to enter data for each of the object’s data attributes. Store the data in the object, then use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve it and display it on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High-Level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "First I created the Employee class, with all the required attributes.  Next I created subclass ProductionWorker, and inherited the name and employee number, as well as added the shift and pay attributes.  Next I created a main function to run the program.  In the main function, I welcome the user, ask for input to create the object.  Next I created the object with the information from the user and used the accessor methods to print an output revealing the information needed to complete the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had the logic down for this but there were quite a few syntax errors, it seemed every time I ran I found 3 more.  I think I'm just not as familliar with writing objects, so it'll come.  For reference in creating this I had an example of a simple example of a class with inheritance up on the other monitor.  That's it for notes, other than reviewing some of my previous work occasionally.\n"

    "In a particular factory, a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who supervises a shift. In addition to a salary, the shift supervisor earns a yearly bonus when his or her shift meets production goals. Write a ShiftSupervisor class that is a subclass of the Employee class you created in Programming Exercise 1. The ShiftSupervisor class should keep a data attribute for the annual salary, and a data attribute for the annual production bonus that a shift supervisor has earned.
