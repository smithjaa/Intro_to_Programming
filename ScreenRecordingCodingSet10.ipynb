    "This method assigns a value to the _ _name field.\n",

    "I was really happy with this exercise.  I usually dive into something a little harder and stress but for just writing my first class and utilizing it, this was great.  I first created the class pet and created an init to assign innitial statements.  Then I just added the methods as requested.  Finally I requested data from a user, and passed that data to the Pet class, and used a final print statement to dislpay all of the information retrieved from the accessor methods.\n"
