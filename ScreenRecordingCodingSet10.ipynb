You can turn off generative AI code-completion within Colab by tapping/clicking the settings icon in the upper right, tapping/clicking the AI Assistance section, and then deselecting \"Consented to use generative AI features\" and selecting \"Hide generative AI features\" (these settings may be returned to their previous states once you've completed this problem).\n",
